# Network Intrusion Detection System
A Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) is a cybersecurity project designed to monitor and analyze network traffic for signs of malicious activities or security threats. It employs a combination of signature-based detection, which identifies known attack patterns, and anomaly-based detection, which identifies deviations from normal network behavior. The NIDS aims to detect and respond to potential intrusions in real-time, enhancing the overall security posture of a network by identifying and mitigating cyber threats.
